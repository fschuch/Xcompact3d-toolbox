Modified the way of working on the project by applying the [Wizard-Template](https://github.com/fschuch/wizard-template):

- [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io) now manages Python installations, virtual environments, dependencies, maintenance scripts, and builds
- [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for static type checking
- [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) as the linter and code formatter
- [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) to check spelling
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/) as the test engine
- [towncrier](https://towncrier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) handles the changelog file
- [Git hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to guarantee consistency and leverage the aforementioned tools
- GitHub workflows and dependabot were reviewed to address the previous points
